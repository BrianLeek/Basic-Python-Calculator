# Sets up a function for addition.

# Sets up a function for subtraction.
def subtraction(x, y):

# Sets up a function for multiplication.
def multiplication(x, y):
    return x * y

# Sets up a function for division.
def division(x, y):
    return x / y

# Gives the user options and let them pick one.

print("2. Subtraction")
print("3. Multiply")

# Gets the remainder of the two numbers.
remainder = number1 % number2

# Addition.

# Subtraction.
elif option == '2':

# Multiplication.
elif option == '3':
    print(number1,"x",number2,"=",multiplication(number1, number2))
# Division.
